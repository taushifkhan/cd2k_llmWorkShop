For example, the scores for the gene's association with type I, II, and III interferon responses are low (2), suggesting that there is limited evidence for such associations. The gene's relevance to circulating leukocytes' immune biology is moderate (4), indicating some evidence supporting this claim. The potential value of the gene as a blood transcriptional biomarker is also moderate (3), whereas its use as a biomarker in clinical settings and its status as a known drug target have low evidence (1 and 0, respectively).
