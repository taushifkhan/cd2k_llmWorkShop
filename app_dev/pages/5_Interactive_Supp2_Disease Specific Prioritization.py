## Automated Candidate Gene Prioritization Workflow for Sepsis Monitoring Using GPT-4 (Azure-OpenAI)
We utilized GPT-4 to analyze genes associated with various aspects of sepsis, including:

(a) Pathogenesis
(b) Host immune response
(c) Organ dysfunction related to sepsis
(d) Circulating immune biology
(e) Clinical biomarkers for sepsis
(f) Potential as a blood transcriptional biomarker
(g) Known drug targets
Each statement was contextually enriched to ensure more accurate responses. For details on the parameters used, refer to the dropdown section below.

To demonstrate the system's scalability, we processed data from the bloodGen3 dataset, which initially contained 11,465 genes. After excluding hypothetical and redundant genes, 10,824 were analyzed for their response. To identify genes specifically relevant to sepsis, we filtered for those with a score of at least 5 on any of the statements, resulting in 1,070 genes, approximately 9.8% of the total analyzed.

The analysis cost about $200 USD and utilized 156 CPU hours.

### Comprehensive Analysis of Gene Clustering in Sepsis-Related Research
Our analysis involves clustering a filtered set of genes to identify sub-groups with similar responses to sepsis-related queries, 
effectively categorizing them from the most to least promising candidates based on their response profiles. 
The results highlight:
1. Clustering Response Profiles: Hierarchical clustering reveals distinct sub-clusters of genes. 
These sub-clusters are formed based on their similarity in response to various sepsis-related statements, 
enabling us to identify genes with potentially critical roles in sepsis pathology and treatment.
2. Identification of Promising Candidates: The clustering approach helps segregate the genes into groups from those showing the 
most promising responses (high scores across different statements) to those deemed least promising, providing a 
focused set of candidates for further investigation.
3.Assessment of Variability in Responses: By examining the variability in response profiles within each cluster for 
different sepsis-related statements, we strengthen our confidence in the reliability of our clustering. 
Clusters 1 and 2, in particular, show consistent high scores with minimal variability across all statements,
underscoring their potential significance in sepsis research.

1. *Hierarchical Clustering of Sepsis-Related Genes Based on Response Scores* :This figure presents a hierarchical clustering analysis of 1,070 genes filtered based on their relevance to sepsis-related queries. 
The dendrogram illustrates the patterns of gene response to sepsis related questions, grouped by similarity in their response scores. 
Each branch represents a cluster of genes that exhibit similar response behaviors, aiding in the identification of potential genetic markers or 
targets for sepsis therapy. The color intensity within each cluster corresponds to the relative confidence levels of the genes, ranging from 0 (low confidence) to 10 (very high confidence), 
providing deeper insights into the reliability of the gene data within the context of sepsis.

2. *Heatmap of Response Score Variability for Sepsis-Related Gene Clusters* : 
This heatmap visualizes the variability and central tendency of response scores across different clusters of sepsis-related genes, categorized by various aspects of sepsis pathology and treatment. 
The rows represent different queries relevant to sepsis and The columns correspond to gene clusters numbered 1 through 5, previously identified in hierarchical clustering analyses. The color gradient from light blue to deep red indicates the median response score for genes within each cluster for the corresponding query, with red denoting a higher median response and blue a lower. The size of each circle indicates the standard deviation of the response scores within each cluster, providing insight into the consistency of gene responses; larger circles signify greater variability.
This heatmap allows for a comparative analysis of gene behavior across clusters, highlighting differences in gene response that may be critical for understanding sepsis mechanisms or developing targeted therapies.

3. *Distribution of Gene Populations Across Clusters* : This bar plot visualizes the distribution of gene counts across five distinct clusters identified in 
the previous hierarchical clustering analysis of sepsis-related genes. Each bar represents a cluster, with the height indicating the number of genes grouped within that cluster. 
The color coding is consistent with the hierarchical plot, providing a visual correlation. Cluster 1 (Red): 203 genes, Cluster 2 (Purple): 201 genes, 
Cluster 3 (Orange): 95 genes, Cluster 4 (Blue): 342 genes, Cluster 5 (Green): 229 genes. These distributions help in assessing the relative size and significance of each cluster, 
potentially correlating with different gene functions or response types associated with sepsis.
            
This structured approach not only refines our understanding of gene behavior in sepsis but also enhances the selection 
process for potential therapeutic targets based on robust statistical evidence. In following section, we have shown the analysis in differernt
resolution, staring from module , Module Function Title and Module Aggregate. With each increimental resolution we aim to opt more coarse-grain over-view of the range of gene
gets effected in the context of Sepsis. These aggregates are well defined in the [BloodGen3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33624743/).
