    "### Customization of prompts for sepsis-specific prioritization: \n",
    "We customized the prompt used in the automated prioritization workflow to focus on sepsis-specific criteria. The modified prompt assessed each gene's relevance to sepsis pathogenesis, host immune response, organ dysfunction, biomarker potential, and therapeutic implications. The customized prompt was designed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Gene [input = official Gene Symbol]\n",
    "1.\tProvide the gene's official name\n",
    "2.\tProvide a brief summary of the gene's function.\n",
    "3.\tGive each of the following statements a score from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no evidence and 10 indicating very strong evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *a.* The gene is associated with the pathogenesis of sepsis. Score: Based on evidence of the gene's involvement in the biological processes underlying sepsis, including but not limited to its role in the dysregulated host response to infection, organ dysfunction, or sepsis-related complications.\n",
    "* *b.* The gene is associated with the host immune response in sepsis. Score: Based on evidence of the gene's involvement in the immune response during sepsis, including but not limited to its role in innate or adaptive immunity, inflammation, or immunosuppression.\n",
    "* *c.* The gene is associated with sepsis-related organ dysfunction. Score: Based on evidence of the gene's involvement in the development or progression of organ dysfunction in sepsis, including but not limited to its role in cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, or neurological dysfunction.\n",
    "* *d.* The gene is relevant to circulating leukocytes immune biology in sepsis. Score: Based on evidence linking the gene to the development, function, or regulation of circulating leukocytes in the context of sepsis, including impacts on leukocyte differentiation, activation, signaling, or effector functions.  \n",
    "* *e.* The gene or its products are currently being used as a biomarker for sepsis in clinical settings. Score: Based on evidence of the gene or its products' application as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring of sepsis in clinical settings, with a focus on their validated use and acceptance in medical practice.\n",
    "* *f.* The gene has potential value as a blood transcriptional biomarker for sepsis. Score: Based on evidence supporting the gene's expression patterns in blood cells as reflective of sepsis or its severity, considering both current research findings and potential for future clinical utility.\n",
    "* *g.* The gene is a known drug target for sepsis treatment. Score: Based on evidence of the gene or its encoded protein serving as a target for therapeutic intervention in sepsis, including approved drugs targeting this gene, compounds in clinical trials, or promising preclinical studies.\n",
    "* *h.* The gene is therapeutically relevant for managing sepsis or its complications. Score: Based on evidence linking the gene to the management or treatment of sepsis or its associated complications, including its role as a potential target for adjunctive therapies or personalized treatment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scoring criteria:*\n",
    "0 - No evidence found 1-3 - Very limited evidence 4-6 - Some evidence, but needs validation or is limited to certain conditions 7-8 - Good evidence 9-10 - Strong evidence\n",

    "This prompt was integrated into the Python scripts that communicate with GPT-4 via the OpenAI and Microsoft Azure APIs, ensuring that the prioritization process was tailored to the specific requirements of sepsis monitoring.\n",
